<p> This Cafe Menu is inspired by the FreeCodeCamp.org exercise under CSS practice.</p>
<p> I integrated an animated background in the menu body to provide some effects when the mouse is hovered on top. </p>
<p> Although the integration is not aesthetically pleasing, the main goal of adding the moving bg is to learn the basics of keyframes and using images to provide animation to elements in the web. </p>
