This landing page is an initiative to practice my current knowledge in HTML and CSS. It implements
1. Using classes, sections, divs
2. Google Fonts, Bootstrap (advance attempt, knowledge only from a Youtube tutorial)
3. flex properties

For improvement:
1. Responsiveness to smaller screens (target future revisions)
2. proper sizing of images
3. more practice in using flex
4. explore Bootstrap more
