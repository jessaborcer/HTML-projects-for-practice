# HTML-projects-for-practice
This repository compiles my journey to mastering HTML and the projects I've worked on in order for me to learn it by heart and apply it to create useful and innovative projects in the future.

1. Recipe Page - a project from The Odin Project
2. Landing Page - a personal project to practice using flex (current learning focus), also implemented Bootstrap (Font Awesome) from a YouTube tutorial.  
3. Cafe Menu - a simple coffee shop menu that uses a moving background through implementing keyframes. Inspired by the coffee menu exercise in the FreeCodeCamp course called Responsive Web Design (Beta)
