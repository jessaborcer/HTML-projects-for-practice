        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3> Sauce: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh strawberries</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3> Directions </h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Generously grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Arrange half the bread cubes in the prepared baking dish. Evenly distribute cream cheese cubes over
                    the bread cube layer; sprinkle 1 1/2 cups sliced strawberries atop cream cheese layer. Layer the
                    remaining bread cubes over strawberry layer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pour half-and-half into a blender; pulse for a few seconds. Blend eggs into half-and-half until fully
                    incorporated. Add maple syrup and blend until smooth. Pour mixture evenly over bread mixture. Cover
                    the baking dish with aluminum foil and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Remove baking dish from refrigerator 45 minutes before baking.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                <p>Bake the covered casserole in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue
                    baking until French toast is puffed and golden brown, about 30 more minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir sugar, water, and cornstarch together in a small saucepan. Cook, stirring occasionally, over
                    medium heat until mixture has thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix in 1 cup sliced strawberries; cook and
                    stir until strawberries have softened, about 10 minutes. Add butter; stir until melted. Serve hot
                    over French toast.</p>
            </li>
