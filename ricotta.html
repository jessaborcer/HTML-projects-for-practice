            <p>If these pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate--and I didn't even separate the eggs
                and
                whip the whites. Also, I used water instead of milk--and I liked them better that way. I like to serve
                these
                with a pat of butter, a pinch of lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.</p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li>
                    <p>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables
                        oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add
                        melted
                        butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring
                        until
                        most of flour disappears into the batter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out 1/4 cup
                        scoops
                        of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the
                        edges of
                        the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through,
                        2 to
                        3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.</p>
